Hi there! I have tried to present the simplest way to cover up almost all the basic topic related to HTML, CSS for the betterment of the beginners! It was a fun to write code and a little bit practice for me. It also also did help me a lot to memorize these ABCD things once again. Hope it would be helpful for the freshers. Cheer up!
